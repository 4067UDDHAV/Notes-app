# Notes-app
I've created a Notes app that allows users to manage notes efficiently. It includes features for adding, editing, deleting, and searching notes. Users can also categorize their notes, with options to add, edit, or remove categories. The app provides a user-friendly interface with error handling through alert boxes, making it easy to organize and retrieve notes based on categories or search terms.
